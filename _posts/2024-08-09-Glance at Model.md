## train loop

## A simple NN üóÑ
muliti-input------>Recurrent NeuralNet----‚Üí Output

When it comes to cross-linking files within your Zettelkasten, there are two general ways of doing so: Either by using an ID, or its filename (without extension). So if you have a file called ‚Äúzettelkasten.md‚Äù you can link to it by writing `[[zettelkasten]]`. Zettlr will try to find a file with that filename and open it.

But what if you change the filename? Then, obviously the link will no longer work! To get around this limitation, you can make use of IDs. IDs are simply strings of digits that you can use to uniquely identify your files. Then you can use them to link to your files. Let‚Äôs create one now! Place the cursor behind the colon and press `Cmd/Ctrl+L`:

Now, this file has an ID which you can make use of! Try it out ‚Äî go back to the tab with the ‚ÄúWelcome to Zettlr!‚Äù-guide, and type `[[` somewhere. From the popup autocomplete, choose this file and confirm your selection. Then, `Cmd/Ctrl`-click on that very link to switch back to this file. You‚Äôll notice that Zettlr has started another search, but, more importantly: you can see the search results highlighted! This is useful both for Zettelkasten-crosslinking, but will of course also come in handy during global searches.

## Advanced NNüè∑
combination of mulit-input and weight assignment --‚Üí recurrent NeuralNet------>output
### the concpet of Weight assignment
Assumed that each input maybe have a different influence on the output by nn.Such as the first input has greatly effect the output,up to 80%,the second input has a lower effect on the output,just 20%.There,80% and 20% is weight assginment what i say.weight assigns on different input.

But creating links is not the only way to create relationships between notes. You can also use tags for this. Tags work exactly like hashtags on Twitter, so you can #create #hashtags #as #much #as #you #want! `Cmd/Ctrl`-clicking these will also start a search and will highlight all files that contain this tag.

There‚Äôs also a tag cloud that you can access by clicking the ‚Äútag‚Äù icon in the toolbar. It will list all your tags and indicate the number of files using it. You can filter and manage your tags from there. While Zettelkasten-links create ‚Äúhard‚Äù connections between files, tags are some sort of ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù connection between related content and may suit you better.

## Final Thoughts üí≠

We won‚Äôt go over methods for how to actually work with a Zettelkasten here, because there are a lot of tutorials out there that will get you started. Here‚Äôs a handy list of good tutorials:

- [A first introduction can be found in our docs](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/academic/zkn-method/)
- [On the concept of the Zettelkasten, read our blogpost](https://zettlr.com/post/what-is-a-zettelkasten)
- [The page zettelkasten.de (in English) contains many articles on Zettelk√§sten](https://zettelkasten.de/)
- [Reddit has a subreddit dedicated solely to the art of Zettelkasten](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten)

These will prove excellent starting points for your journey to learn the arcane art of creating a Zettelkasten!

One last thing though: As the way Zettelk√§sten work is not very standardized, and there exist many right ways of doing it, Zettlr allows you to fully customize every single aspect of the Zettelkasten-methodology. To get started, have a look at [our documentation on how that works](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/reference/settings/#zettelkasten)!
